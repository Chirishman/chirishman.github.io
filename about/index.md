### What is this blog about?

This is a place to share various PowerShell tools and tidbits that I come across and build. I work in a primarily Windows/Hyper-V environment with some amount of Linux so a lot of my posts will be relevant to that kind of environment.

Depending on my inclination this may grow in scope to include some Raspi, IoT, mechanical keyboard related posts.

### Who are you?

I am a primarily Windows based Sysadmin and automation scripter with a background in BI dashboarding/integration.
