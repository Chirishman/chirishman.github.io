Iâ€™m keeping a list of PowerShell resources that I've found helpful.  I plan to keep this up to date and add resources on a regular basis, so you may want to check back occasionally.

### Cheat sheets and quick references



### Blogs and other resources



### Communities



### Videos and Podcasts



### Books and eBooks



### Code Repositories



### Tools, Add-ons, and PowerShell Goodies
