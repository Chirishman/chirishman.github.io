This is a quick hit on my thoughts of the PowerShell summit.

### Exciting times

It's an exciting time to be automating and designing solutions on the Microsoft side of the house.

I'll skip the first day and stick to the takeaways I'm leaving with. Hit [the first day's post](http://ramblingcookiemonster.github.io/PowerShell-Summit-Day-One/) for a few notes on using GitHub, Pester, and AppVeyor, and other excitement.

### The PowerShell community is fantastic

* Roughly half the *"oh, that idea/tool could solve a problem I have!"* discoveries were from side discussions and chatting over food. The rest were in the sessions you can [find on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfeA8kIs7CochwcgX9zOWxh4IL3GoG05P) (mostly).
* Met a lot of extremely talented and friendly folks. If you aren't already, get involved with the community on Twitter and other mediums!
  * It helps you discover and learn new ideas and tools you can use in your solutions.
  * It makes it a bit easier to strike up a conversation with fellow PowerShellers at events like this.
  * It's hard to borrow and extend your stuff if you don't share it - there are so many talented folks out there with solutions that could help the community at large. Please contribute, Boe might get tired of me borrowing his stuff : )

### Microsoft is heading in the right direction

* Expanding their embrace of open source will benefit both Microsoft and their customers. Pester, an open source solution, will be included in Windows. DSC Resources are on GitHub, where the community can help contribute to improve the solution. We all win.
* Nano will bring some exciting changes, and help enable a number of concepts Jeffrey has been trying to sell (e.g. servers as cattle, servers are not clients).
* The future is bright. We already know Jeffrey predicted an open source PowerShell; we're seeing steps in that direction, Jeffrey re-affirmed that prediction, and all signs point to a more agile and open Microsoft under Satya.

### Rambling
